# Routes Directory Documentation

This directory contains the routing scripts for our application, handling different aspects of user interaction and data processing. Each script is responsible for specific functionalities and integrates with the core application logic.

## Files Overview

### 1. `finalize_claim_route.py`
This script handles the finalization of claims. It involves checking claim statuses, updating user and claim databases, and managing collateral transfers based on the claim's outcome.

### 2. `generate_claim_route.py`
This file defines the logic for generating new claims. It includes functionalities such as validating collateral, checking for existing claims, locking funds, creating and registering new claims, and updating user data.

### 3. `generate_dispute_route.py`
Handles the creation and processing of disputes against claims. It performs checks on validator stakes, claim existence, claim eligibility for dispute, and transfers the stake to a locked account.

### 4. `hello_route.py`
A simple route that demonstrates basic request handling with 'hello' routes. It includes URL-based and JSON-based router handling for sending messages to the rollup machine.

### 5. `register_deposit_route.py`
Manages ERC20 deposit processes. It checks the type of token deposited, creates user accounts if necessary, and updates user balances in the bank database.

### 6. `validate_claim_route.py`
Focuses on validating and finalizing claims. This script includes functions for calculating endpoint usage, validating claims based on preprocessed data and computation proofs, and finalizing claims.

### 7. `withdraw_route.py`
Handles withdrawal requests. This script validates withdrawal payloads, processes withdrawals from user accounts, generates ERC20 transfer vouchers, and sends notices with updated balances.
